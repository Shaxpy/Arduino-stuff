This is a compilation of my journey with Arduino, since beginning of B.tech!

I was skeptical to upload these since, actual industrial application of robotics doesn't necessarily involve Arduino based robots.<br>
But,then realised the efforts I had put in studying IMUs, their DoFs, and RTCs etc.

##What all is there?
Stuff about NodeMCU, MPU6050, RTC(timer), OLED displays and so on!
